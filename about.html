	  <p>
	    jsCanvas is a fork
	    of <a href="https://github.com/loopspace/LuaCanvas">luaCanvas</a>
	    which uses javascript instead of lua to provide a simple
	    environment for programming animations using
	    the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">HTML5
	    canvas element</a>.
	    The goal is to create a playground where it is possible to
	    easily create graphical programs.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It is heavily inspired by the awesome iPad App
	    <a href="http://codea.io/">Codea</a> which is a fantastic
	    environment in which to simply have fun while learning to
	    program.  The only downside of Codea is that it only runs
	    on an iPad, making it impractical to use as a teaching
	    tool where iPads are not already in use.  Thus LuaCanvas
	    and then jsCanvas
	    was developed to provide the same experience but more
	    widely available.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Although inspired by Codea and with many features borrowed
	    from Codea, it is not a clone.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The components involved in designing jsCanvas were:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li><strong>Javascript</strong>: Although the original
	      project used the Lua language, which is very
	      straightforward and compact, running a lua VM in
	      javascript proved problematic with regard to controlling
	      memory.  Thus this version uses javascript to avoid that
	      issue but retains the original extensions and
	      environment to make it straightforward to create simple
	      animations.
	    <li><strong>Graphics</strong>: The great thing about
	      Codea was that it gave you an easy way to do graphical
	      programming.  It itself was following in the tradition
	      of Processing.  Graphics is <em>fun</em>, but also
	      with a high education potential.  It is hard to do
	      much without any mathematics.
	    <li><strong>Browser</strong>: The goal was to make
	      jsCanvas work anywhere without installing any software.
	      This effectively meant that it had to work in a
	      browser as that can be reliably assumed to exist on
	      every computer.
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    All of these considerations led to the choice of using
	     JavaScript with extra functions that
	    give the code access to an HTML5 Canvas element.  It
	    is hoped that this will prove to be an enjoyable
	    environment in which to learn some programming (and
	    mathematics).

	    jsCanvas is built using:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://codemirror.net/">Code Mirror</a>
	      for the editing environment.
	    <li><a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and parts of
	    the <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a> to make
	    life easier in the code. 
	  </ul>
